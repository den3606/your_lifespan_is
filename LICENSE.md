      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

**Noita - Modding Agreement**

This modding agreement is a legally binding agreement between you and Nolla Games Oy, governing the creation and distribution of Mods relating to the video game ‘Noita’ (the Software). Mods are any derivate works, enhancements, modifications or adaptations that incorporate, interact or integrate with the Software (Mods).

If entering this Modding Agreement on behalf of a company, you warrant that you are authorised to bind the company to this agreement.

By creating or distributing any Mod, you accept these terms. If you do not accept these terms, you are not authorised to create or distribute any Mod.

You are still bound by possible End User Licence Agreement (EULA) of the Software, but these terms override the EULA where there is any inconsistency between the two agreements.

**Mods**

You may not create or distribute any Mod, or decompile or reverse engineer the Software, other than as expressly permitted in this Modding Agreement, or otherwise permitted by law that cannot be excluded by contract.

Mods are ONLY permitted with the Full/Paid Version of the Software.

**Permission to Modify**

Subject to the terms of this Modding Agreement, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, royalty-free licence to use, modify and adapt the content in the Software through the modding API, to create a Mod that adds new content, and distribute that Mod for non-commercial purposes.

We reserve the right to terminate this licence for any reason at any time by notice on our website or via email.

**What this Means:** Provided you comply with these terms, you may create and distribute Mods for the Software for non-commercial purposes.

**Proprietary Rights**

Nolla Games Oy retains ownership of, and reserves all rights in the Software. You own any Mods you create; to the extent they are distinct from the Software. No proprietary rights are assigned or transferred under this Modding Agreement.

You grant us an irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive licence to use, copy, modify, and adapt your Mod. Further, you irrevocably authorise us to distribute your Mod with the Software (attributing you as author), and grant corresponding sub-licences to end-users.

**What this Means:** We own the software. You own Mods you create. But as the two are designed to work together, and your Mods build upon our existing work, we also have the right to use, test and modify your mod, and distribute it for free with the Software.

**Commercial Distribution Prohibited Without Consent**

You may not sell, impose a fee, or distribute any mod for any commercial purpose, or in connection with any commercial enterprise, without our prior express consent in writing.

**What this Means:** If you want to sell, rent, or use your mod for any commercial purpose, you need our permission. Contact business@nollagames.com to discuss any other commercial options.

**Software Assets**

Mods may add to and enhance the Software, but you must not distribute a substantial part of our copyrightable code, content, assets or any other parts of the Software with the Mod. Mods may not contain any original or modified object files or binaries that are part of the Software.

**What this Means:** While Mods can change and patch the game they cannot distribute a substantial part of the original Software. Mods cannot distribute any binaries or object files that are part of the Software.

**Restrictions on Mods**

Unless otherwise permitted by law, Mods must not:

1) Bring Nolla Games Oy or the Software into disrepute;
1) Work around any digital rights management (DRM), technological protection measure,  or like limitation in the Software;
1) Recreate or mimic the data or functionality of the Software (e.g. ports to another OS);
1) Include any defamatory, illegal, or obscene content, or enable the Software to be used for any such purpose;
1) Include any malware, spyware, virus, or third party self installing software;
1) Incorporate any third party trade marks or publicity rights without consent of the owner;

Infringe, or cause us to infringe any third party intellectual property rights (including any breach of software licences of third party components incorporated into the Software – a list of these third party components is available under the licenses folder inside the directory the Software is installed in.

**Privacy of End Users**

Your Mod must comply with all applicable privacy laws. Your Mod may not collect or store any personal information of end users without first obtaining express consent to do so from the user. Note that usage of the Software (including in association with your Mod), remains subject to our Privacy Policy. Our privacy policy is available on our website at <https://nollagames.com/privacy_policy.txt>.

**Indemnity and Limitation of Liability**

To the fullest extent allowable at law, you agree to release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless us, and our officers, employees, agents and contractors from any and all notice, demand, action, proceeding, litigation, investigation, judgment, damage, loss (including indirect, special or consequential loss), cost, expense (including legal fees on a solicitor and own client basis) and liability, however arising, whether present, unascertained, immediate, future or contingent, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence) or statute and whether involving us or a third party, that arises from or in relation to your Mod.

**What this Means:** You are entirely and solely responsible for your Mod. If anything in relation to your Mod causes any loss at all, that cost is on you, not us.

**Severability**

If any of these terms are held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of law, that part will be excluded, and the remaining valid terms will remain in full force.

**Entire Agreement**

This Modding Agreement, and those documents expressly incorporated by reference, contain the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous negotiations or agreements relating to your right to create and distribute Mods.

**Updates to this Modding Agreement**

We may update this Modding Agreement from time to time by notice on our website, or by including the updated Modding Agreement in a Software update. Such variation will be effective upon posting those notifications and changes on our website, or your installing the Software update, without further notice to you.

**Waiver**

Any delay or failure to exercise or enforce our rights under this Modding Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of those rights, nor preclude any future exercise of those rights.

**Legal Fees**

In the event that we obtain the legal assistance to enforce this Modding Agreement for your apparent breach of these terms, all legal fees (on a solicitor own client basis) incurred in enforcing this Modding Agreement may be recovered from you.

**Dispute Resolution**

You agree that in case of a dispute or claim, you will first attempt to informally negotiate a settlement or resolution of the dispute by contacting [business@nollagames.com](mailto:legal@greenheartgames.com) and informing us in a comprehensive way of the grounds of your dispute before resorting to any legal action.
